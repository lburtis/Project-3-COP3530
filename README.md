Sorting Algorithm Comparison: QuickSort vs MergeSort
Source code for merge sort and quick sort algorithms

This program compares the performance of QuickSort and MergeSort by measuring the execution time and number of comparisons made during sorting.

1. Requirements:
C++ Compiler or CLion IDE
Input files in files/ directory:
- sorted_numbers.txt
- reverse_numbers.txt
- random_numbers.txt

2. How to Run:
Prepare Input Files: Create a files directory with sample data text files. Each file should contain one number per line and have exactly 100,000 lines.
3 are given: sorted_numbers is 1-100,000 (already sorted), reverse_numbers is 100,000-1 (in reverse order), and random_numbers is a predetermined randomly ordered list with no repeat numbers

4. Check Results:
Performance metrics are printed in the console.  It may take several seconds to run

5. Sorted outputs are saved in:
- merge_sorted_numbers_output.txt
- merge_reverse_numbers_output.txt
- merge_random_numbers_output.txt
- quick_sorted_numbers_output.txt
- quick_reverse_numbers_output.txt
- quick_random_numbers_output.txt
