Sorting Algorithm Comparison: QuickSort vs MergeSort
Source code for merge sort and quick sort algorithms


This program compares the performance of QuickSort and MergeSort by sorting datasets and measuring the number of comparisons and execution time.

1. Requirements:
C++ Compiler or CLion IDE
Input files in files/ directory:
- sorted_numbers.txt
- reverse_numbers.txt
- random_numbers.txt

2. How to Run:
Prepare Input Files: Create a files/ directory with test files. Each file should contain one number per line.


3. Check Results:
Performance metrics are printed in the console.

4. Sorted outputs are saved in:
- sorted_numbers_output.txt
- reverse_numbers_output.txt
- random_numbers_output.txt
